# action-cleanup-package

This is a GitHub Action to delete GitHub packages. It is very useful to clean up unneeded Docker
images in the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) after a PR is closed.

The example below removes Docker images in ghcr.io with the specified package name and tag. Here, `github-token`
is set to a secret, `CI_ACTION_TOKEN`, which is a personal access token with package deletion permissions.

```
